    "### Binary tree\n",
    "We cant talk about a rooted Binary tree before talking about what is a binary Tree. \n",
    "A Binary tree is a hierarchal data struture where the nodes can have two children at maximum and the child nodes are called the left and right child.\n",
    "![Binary tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-tree.png)\n",
    "### Binary Trees have many properties\n",
    "* A binary tree can have a 2 nodes at level l if the level of the root is zero.\n",
    "* When a node has one or two children the number of leaf nodes is one more then the number of nodes with children\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "* Search operation of a binary tree is faster\n",
    "* easy to pick the max and min elements \n",
    "* converting different postfix and prefix are possible with binary trees.\n",
    "### Rooted Binary trees\n",
    "A rooted Binary tree is connected acyclkic graph where a specific node that is labbled the \"root\" of the tree. The root serves as a point of reference for other vertices in the tree. In Pictures of binary trees majority of the time the root will be the node sitting at the top to easily tell it apart and list the other vertices below.\n"

    "## How Does Heap sort algorithm work\n",
    "### Heap\n",
    "Before Talking about the heap sort algoritim it is important to understand the meaning of heap in computational terms. According to educative.io  <a href=\"https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-heap\" target=\"_blank\">\"Heaps are advanced data structures that are useful for specific use-cases such as sorting and implementing priority queues.\"</a> Following on from what we learned above about binary trees Heaps must be a complete binary tree. There are two Types of heap\n",
    "* Max Heap\n",
    "* Min Heap \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Max Heap\n",
    "Max Heaps means that all parent node keys that are part of a binary tree must be greater or equal to their child node. key(A)>=key(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Max Heap](https://www.educative.io/api/edpresso/shot/5170884784422912/image/5724160613416960)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Min Heap\n",
    "Min Heap means that all child node keys are greater than or equal to their parental nodes. key(A)<=key(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Min Heap](https://www.educative.io/api/edpresso/shot/5170884784422912/image/5685265389584384)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Differences between the two different Heap types other then order of smallest to largest is that in a min heap the smallest element is the first to be popped from the heap while in max heap the opposite is said that the largest element is the first to be popped off from the heap. Another difference is during the construction of the heap the largest element has priority is max heap while the smallest element has priority in min heap."
