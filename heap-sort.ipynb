    "### Binary tree\n",
    "We cant talk about a rooted Binary tree before talking about what is a binary Tree. \n",
    "A Binary tree is a hierarchal data struture where the nodes can have two children at maximum and the child nodes are called the left and right child.\n",
    "![Binary tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-tree.png)\n",
    "### Binary Trees have many properties\n",
    "* A binary tree can have a 2 nodes at level l if the level of the root is zero.\n",
    "* When a node has one or two children the number of leaf nodes is one more then the number of nodes with children\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "* Search operation of a binary tree is faster\n",
    "* easy to pick the max and min elements \n",
    "* converting different postfix and prefix are possible with binary trees.\n",
    "### Rooted Binary trees\n",
    "A rooted Binary tree is connected acyclkic graph where a specific node that is labbled the \"root\" of the tree. The root serves as a point of reference for other vertices in the tree. In Pictures of binary trees majority of the time the root will be the node sitting at the top to easily tell it apart and list the other vertices below.\n"
